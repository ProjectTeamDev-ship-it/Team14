                <p>
                    Moving to a new city, adjusting to university life, and figuring out how things work can be overwhelming. 
                    Whether you're a local student or an international student arriving in Halifax for the first time, 
                    DalConnect is here to make your transition smoother.

                    At Dalhousie University, students come from all over the world, each facing different challenges as they settle in. 
                    International students may need to get their Social Insurance Number (SIN) for work, open a bank account, 
                    or buy a SIM card to stay connected. Local students, on the other hand, may be searching for off-campus housing 
                    or applying for a Nova Scotia ID. No matter your situation, DalConnect has all the information you need in one place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our goal is to save you time by providing step-by-step guides, reliable resources, and essential checklists. 
                    Instead of searching across multiple websites, DalConnect simplifies the process, helping you focus on what matters: 
                    settling in, meeting new people, and starting your university journey on the right foot.
